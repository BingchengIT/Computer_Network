1. I used Bingchengs-MacBook-Air(my own computer) undergrad environment to build and test on my program.

2. My compilers version is javac 1.6.0_65.

3. In my program, firstly in the undergrad environment I compile the program by typing "make",
   then, use command "java server &", it will make a single thread to run server class and tell me
   the The current n_port number is 3001. After that, type enter keyboard again, then use command
   "java client localhost 3001 "Hello world"", lastly, it will give me a r_port number and 
   the reversed string of "Hello world" => "dlrow olleh". If the input is not valid, my program will 
   hand exception and print "Invalid input".
   
4. In my program, it only supports that server handles one request and then exits. If you want to handle
   the second request, you have to connect server again.
